# Rainbow Challenge: 
This simple page shows the standard colors of the standard rainbow as the mouse moves across. It should be noted that there is an alpha value which makes the top of the screen appear pastel and the bottom of the screen appear fully hued. Gradient change is smooth throughout. 

The rgba values are logged to the console, but if you want the values where your mouse is currently, click the screen and it will alert you of said values.

It will scale to the window size.
